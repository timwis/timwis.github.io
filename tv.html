<p>I quite enjoy good television series. Some of them so much that I recommend them
to others. I'm very selective about my recommendations, so the list below
represents only "hands down" great television series.</p>

<p>Having seen my favorite series, is there a series you think I'd like?

{% assign shows = site.data.shows | sort: 'title' %}
<div class="pure-g">
  {% for show in shows %}
  {% capture thumbnail %}https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/{{ show.tvdb_thumbnail }}.jpg{% endcapture %}

  <div class="pure-u-1-2 pure-u-lg-1-3">
    <div class="show-thumbnail">
      <a href="{{ show.url }}">
        <img class="pure-img" src="{{ thumbnail }}" alt="{{ show.title }}" />
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>

  {% endfor %}
</div>
