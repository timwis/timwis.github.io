In a City where 41% of households do not have internet access, TextBlast provided a way for community groups to connect with those residents through text messaging. Community groups often send a mass email reminding neighbors about an upcoming meeting. TextBlast allowed the groups to collect cell phone numbers in the neighborhood and send that kind of reminder through text message, looping in those who may not have or use email at home. The service was provided free of charge, and was intended for groups like civic associations, CDCs, business associations, and other community builders.
