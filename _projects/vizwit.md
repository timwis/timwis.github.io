An interactive data visualization tool that uses a [JSON config file](https://gist.github.com/timwis/601224472a5d53cbb908)
to generate interactive charts that cross-filter one another. This tool enables open data providers to create showcases for 
their datasets that allow users to navigate through the data and answer important questions without having to know what to 
do with a giant spreadsheet, thereby broadening the audience of open data.
