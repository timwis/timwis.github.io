The office that oversees elections in the City of Philadelphia provides live election results
on a [rather old site](http://phillyelectionresults.com/). At a [Code for Philly](http://codeforphilly.org)
hack night, we built a tool to scrape the official results every 30 seconds and provide a simple,
mobile-friendly interface that auto-refreshes.

The City Commissioners Office has since [adopted](https://codeforphilly.org/blog/vote_and_watch_whowonphilly)
the site as the official tool for live election results.
