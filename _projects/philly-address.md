PhillyAddress extracts data from the Office of Property Assessment‘s web site and presents it in an easy-to-use mobile application, as well as an API that other software is built upon. In addition, PhillyAddress allows users to search for properties by the owner’s name, a core feature left out of the OPA’s web site.
