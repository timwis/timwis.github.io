Open-source data portals can be really hard to install and maintain. But their basic purpose
of providing links to download data really isn't that complicated. JKAN is a proof-of-concept
that allows a small, resource-strapped government agency to stand-up an open data portal by simply
[clicking the fork button](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). The result is a 
lightweight, backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll.
