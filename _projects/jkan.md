Open-source data portals can be [really](https://twitter.com/waldojaquith/status/282599673569619969).
[hard](https://twitter.com/chris_whong/status/669207423719235584). to install and maintain. But their
basic purpose of providing links to download data really isn't that complicated. JKAN is a proof-of-concept
that allows a small, resource-strapped government agency to stand-up an open data portal by simply
[clicking the fork button](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). The result is a lightweight,
backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll.
