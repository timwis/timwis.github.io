Query [Esri Geoservices](http://geoservices.github.io/) using a [SODA2](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/)-style API.
Geoservices are a type of API that is common among cities that use Esri's GIS products but carries a steep learning curve.
This tool puts a more familiar, SQL-like interface from Socrata in front of them. Theoretically, tools built against a
Socrata API would work against a Geoservices endpoint using this tool.
