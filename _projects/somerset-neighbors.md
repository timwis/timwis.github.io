Recognizing that the neighborhood with the biggest drug corner in the region had no civic association, the 24th Police District Advisory Council partnered with the New Kensington CDC to knock on doors and bring neighbors out to a meeting every month. These meetings became very popular, with attendance ranging from 40-90 neighbors per meeting, and eventually formed into Somerset Neighbors for Better Living, with by-laws and a Board of neighbors.
