SubscribeMe is meant to be a service for developers who want to let their users subscribe to updates from their application, but aren't thrilled about having to write code for confirmation emails, unsubscribe functionality, scheduling the emails, and worrying about how it will scale. Using SubscribeMe, developers can simply specify the data source's API, configure an email template, and add a "subscribe" button to their application.
