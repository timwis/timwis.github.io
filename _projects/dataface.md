Have you ever wanted to open a database, create a table, add a few fields and some data? So has just about every other developer! So why is there no free, open source, multi-platform application with a modern-looking UI available? And if there were, it would probably be just for one flavor of database.

Dataface aims to be just that, and hopefully for multiple flavors of database (at least Postgres and MySQL, maybe more). It won't be as fully-featured as some of the other tools out there, but it will provide the simple stuff simply.
