A product of Random Hacks of Kindness hackathon, PhillySNAP allows users to text their street address to 267-293-9387 to find the nearest SNAP/Food Stamp-accepting Farmers Market, and the closest two SNAP-participating healthy corner stores. We partnered with the Food Trust to advertise the program on pamphlets being distributed to welfare recipients.
