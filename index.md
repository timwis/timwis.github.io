As Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, Wisniewski and his team helped departments release over [200 open data sets][opendataphilly] and increase transparency around [city contracts][contracts], [property taxes][property-taxes], [police interactions][police-interactions], and the [city budget][budget].
