Tim Wisniewski is an eternal optimist who sees government as full of hard-working people serving a public that’s understandably skeptical because their experience of government is often confusing, time-consuming, downtown, and impersonal. In his role as Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, Tim leads the [Office of Open Data & Digital Transformation][oddt], where he gets to focus on that just that conundrum.

As Chief Data Officer, Wisniewski and his team have helped departments release over [200 open data sets][opendataphilly] and increase transparency around [city contracts][contracts], [property taxes][property-taxes], [police interactions][police-interactions], and the [city budget][budget]. To begin to build a more intuitive digital experience, he and his team have also launched the new [phila.gov][philagov], an effort to transform the City’s website around the needs of its users.

Before joining the Administration in January 2012, Tim was the Executive Director of the [Frankford Special Services District][fssd], where he led efforts to revitalize the Frankford Avenue Business Corridor through public safety and beautification projects. As President of the 24th Police District Advisory Council, he also helped to form [Somerset Neighbors][snbl], a civic association in Kensington.

A Philadelphia native, Tim is a graduate of Richmond, the American International University in London. He enjoys using the latest JavaScript libraries for side projects and taking his dog, [Decaf][decaf], to the dog park near his northern liberties home.
